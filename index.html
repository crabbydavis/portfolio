			I'm currently a student at Brigham Young University doing a Computer Engineering major and Computer Science minor. I enjoy working in teams to solve problems and the collective feeling of triumph when meeting success. I love reading books that deal with business and self-improvement and have found an outlet for my desire to innovate in doing app development. I'm passionate about sports including soccer, ping pong, and inner tube water polo. My ultimate endeavor is to innovate in developing countries with my dear wife Anna.

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p id="project_text">I really enjoy doing Android app development and have done a few different apps including an Asteroids game, a Family Map, and a game called Get2Know. Recently I've been learning how to do web programming and have a few examples of those projects that I've done below.
